fwding v0.1 Alpha
Written by Foeh Mannay, January 2013

PURPOSE
=======

"fwding" is a tool which attempts to measure the forwarding delay incurred by 
packets passing through a device. It takes a pcap file as input and outputs CSV
formatted text detailing the arrival and departure frame numbers and timestamps,
plus the time delta between arrival and departure.

The pcacp file must be in the original tcpdump format (i.e. not pcapng) and must
contain a capture of both sides of the forwarding device. In other words it must
contain a copy of each frame entering and leaving the device under test.

It uses the last 20 bytes of each frame to identify "before and after" pairs;
test equipment by Spirent (and probably others) store a signature at the end of
each frame, so this technique works very well. With "real" traffic your mileage
will vary depending on how much entropy is in the last 20 bytes. A stream of
compressed or encrypted data *should* give reasonable results, but any traffic
which is repetetive in nature (OSPF hellos, LACPDUs, etc) will generate a lot of
false matches. For best results, filter any non-test traffic from the pcap file
before running it through fwding.

Output timestamps are in seconds since Unix epoch. Time delta is measured in
seconds.

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on the
theory behind this if you are interested.

INSTALLATION
============

It should be possible to simply extract the source code, cd into the directory
then run "make".

USAGE
=====

There is only one parameter, and that is mandatory. You must specify your
capture file (original pcap format) directly on the command line.

Here's an example:

lab@lab:~/fwding$ ./fwding infile.cap
Arrival Frame Number, Arrival Time, Departure Frame Number, Departure Time, Forwarding Delay
1, 1359455739.248146, 2, 1359455739.248161, 0.000015
3, 1359455739.252175, 4, 1359455739.252225, 0.000050
11, 1359455739.286297, 12, 1359455739.286311, 0.000014
15, 1359455739.286660, 16, 1359455739.286798, 0.000138
19, 1359455739.319249, 20, 1359455739.319300, 0.000051
21, 1359455739.319606, 22, 1359455739.319742, 0.000136
23, 1359455739.322433, 24, 1359455739.322570, 0.000137
lab@lab:~/fwding$

The output can be piped to other tools or redirected to file for consumption by
your favourite spreadsheet or utility.

Quick and dirty graphs can be obtained by running gnu plot against the output.
For example to obtain a scatter chart of latency over time, open the gnuplot CLI
and use:

plot "fwding.csv" using 2:5 with points pt 2

Alternatively to plot latency against packet number, use:

plot "fwding.csv" using 1:5 with points pt 2
